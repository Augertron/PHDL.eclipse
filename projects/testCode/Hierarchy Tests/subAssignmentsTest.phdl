 *	Hierarchy Test Code
 *		SubDesign Assignments
 *
 *	Date:	December 1, 2011
 *	Author:	Richard Black
 *	
 *	Testing Objective:
 *		Making sure that the parser will compile code with sub design
 *		instances and assignments made within them
 *
 *	Testing Procedure:
 *		The code below is copied into the Eclipse ANTLR Interpreter
 *		for the PHDL.g file.
 *
 *		Note that ANTLR has some strange issues when running with
 *		the default settings.  Save the test code under the
 *		appropriate rule and select "Run (Java)" in the dropdown
 *		menu found under the "Run" button.
