Error Log
--------------------------

*	Typo on "floating net" warning
		Current says "floading net: " :P

*	Throw error when refPrefix is overwritten with an invalid
	prefix.
		i.e.
				attr refPrefix = "P";	// Initially
				refPrefix = "3";			// Overwritting

Possible Improvements?
--------------------------

* Allowing for multiple net declarations on a single line.
		i.e. net x,y,z;

* Allowing for multiple pin declarations on a single line.
		i.e. pin a,b,c = {1,2,3};

* Suppressing "unused device" warnings?
		A designer might use a device library but not all of the
		devices found in it.

*	Slight modification of attribute overwritting message for newattr
		i.e. (inside instance)
			newattr tolerance = "5%";
			tolerance = "10%";
				//makes the following warning:
					// atribute already overwritten: tolerance
				//technically a newattr isn't an overwrite, is it?

*	Different error message when trying to assign a pin to a non-existant
	net.
		i.e.
			a = non_net; // non_net never declared, and a is a single bit pin.
				// Produces the following message:
					// invalid assignment, left size is 1 right size is 0: a
				// It would be nice to know that "non_net" is an undeclared net
				// instead.

* A good way to test the compiler's warning and error system is to have
	somebody take a good design and put several bugs in it.  Then have
	somebody else try to debug it with the compiler only.
