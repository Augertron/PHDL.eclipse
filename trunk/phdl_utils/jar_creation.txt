Hey, to make the executable jar file for phdl_utils do this. 

Inside eclipse -> right click on the project -> export -> executable jar file.  

At this point you are in a wizard.  You have to select one of the launch files. I don't know why.

Then select the the radio button to export libraries into the jar file.

Tell it where you want your jar file to go. Default is in the workspace root.

Good luck.
