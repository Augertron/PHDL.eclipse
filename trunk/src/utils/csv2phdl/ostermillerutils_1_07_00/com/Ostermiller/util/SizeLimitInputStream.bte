<p>Many Internet protocols and file types specify byte lengths for certain sections of data just prior
to the section of data.  Size Limit Input Stream provides a mechanism for the entire data to be 
opened as a stream, and then section of the data be parceled out to other handlers.  The handler
is easier to write because its mission is no longer "read from this stream and process the data, but
be careful not to read more than 398 bytes", but rather "read all the data from this stream and
process the data."   Handlers that are easier to write have fewer bugs.   This also allows handlers
that know how to process a stream, but may not have been written with sub-streams in mind, to
be re-purposed without a change to the handler code.</p>

<p>An example of a protocol for a Size Limit Input Stream would be appropriate is the HTTP 1.1 
protocol.  In the HTTP 1.1 protocol a header for the web page is sent that contains (among other
things) the size of the document.  The document is then sent, and the stream is left open for
subsequent requests.  An implementation of an HTTP 1.1  client might read the headers, determine 
the size, and then pass off the actual document handling to another class via a 
SizeLimitInputStream.</p>
